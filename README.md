The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.


Let's suppose that the Unicorn is a family business and is owned by 2 stakeholders who are very invested in their business. They already have a small data analytics team but want to expand it significantly over the next few months. They see you as a candidate for a DA position and provide you with a sample dataset from their sales data.


Your task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost its business growth.
